Javascript is super lit. Every day is interesting for me right now because I am learning so much. Some stream of thought things I like about it in particular right now are: yarn is sick, JSX is crazy, React is ... interesting, create-react-app is crazy convenient.

On top of diving head first into Javascript I've also switched to developing almost specifically on atom and Ubuntu. Atom is sleek, and I like how package-centric it is. Paired with terminal I feel like I'm working twice as fast as I used to. I'm also getting noticeably better at using git on the command line. It is easier and more powerful than I ever imagined.

I'm in New York for the weekend, and even though I'm here I've still already put in another 10 hours of staring at Javascript. Its definitely a breath of fresh air and going forward into my future of Seattle software development I truly cannot wait.
