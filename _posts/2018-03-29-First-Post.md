Wow, isn't this blog lovely? Welcome to my first real post. Here I'll hopefully (as long as I don't lose interest and never post) be documenting my life, projects, and various thoughts that I want to write down, I'll probably write a good bit about my current journey of FUNemployment as well. Right now I have some interesting projects happening so they should be nice fuel for some in depth posts discussing analysis and software design.

Shoutout to @austin-garrard for this sick blog that I stole. This is a first for me, but I intend on using it to learn more about HTML and website design in general.

Thats all for now,
Dan.
