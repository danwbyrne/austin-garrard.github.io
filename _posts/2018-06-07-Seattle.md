I just finished moving into my Seattle apartment. So far things are going swell; my cat has had a great transition even after the ~8 hours of travel we had to take and my apartment has turned out to be much more than I expected originally. I still don't have a bed frame or any furniture yet, and worst of all there is no WiFi until Saturday so I'm writing this post offline.

Work at Neo Tracker starts Monday, although I am heading to the office tomorrow to say hello. I've got a lot of learning to do over the next few months but I'm ready to become the JS-lord I know I can be. JavaScript is a lot to take in but everyday I seem to find something new that 'wows' me. I've got some ideas for a REST/socket.io project that sounds like a great idea in my head right now. We'll see if anything becomes of it.

This apartment could be a pretty gnarly place if I put in some work to spruce it up. The amenities at this place are top-notch and the package-courier system for picking up packages is as next level as it comes. My car is HOPEFULLY getting picked up for delivery tomorrow, driving here actually sucks so far but I really want to have the freedom to drive around Washington on weekend. I'd really like to get into hiking, especially while I have the opportunity to work towards climbing something cool like MT Rainier.

I really need a chair.
