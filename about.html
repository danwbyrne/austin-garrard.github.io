<h3>About</h3>

<p>
	Hi there! My name is Daniel Byrne, I'm an aspiring software developer / data analyst living in Maryland. My main expertise is in Python however recently I am trying to branch out into new areas (currently Javascript). I try to keep busy with projects (including this blog) which you can find on my github linked below. I'll probably update this page some more in the future but thats all about me for now.
